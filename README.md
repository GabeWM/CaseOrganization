# CaseOrganization
My father is a Thoracic Surgeon at Georgetown University Hospital and had a collection of word documents that had information about each case he performed yearly. I parsed through the word document where each line was a case. The lines had many inconsistences in format which made the regex very hard and was great practice on parsing strings. I outputted this information into a word document. 

Note: this is confidential information thus the input/output will not be posted (I also did not see this information)
